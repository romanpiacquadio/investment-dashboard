# Investments Calculation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will be able to visualize 3 different dashboards for your your future investment:
  - The yearly cashflow, starting by 'Year 0', which represents the initial investment.
  - The net present value as function of discount rate.
  - The revenue vs profit bar chart.

Make sure you install all necessary dependencies by running:
### `npm install`

You can start the application by running:
